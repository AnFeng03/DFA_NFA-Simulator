The following project is designed to work with Finite Automata machines. It implements an interface to create and use them, and implements an algorithm to convert between NFAs and DFAs

(Building Instructions) Input the following in the command line:
gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -o programName *.c

(Running Instructions) Input the following in the command line:
./programName

(Note: the NFA translator on the third requirment for the NFA (multiple characters) may take a while depending on the computer used)
